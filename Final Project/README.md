Our team decided to explore Airbnb data to see if there was some meaningful trend in the evidence 
to support or reject the "uptrending real estate" hypothesis. According to current conversation in the
media, there was some reason to believe that Airbnb has impacted real estate markets across the country.
For the purpose of a semester-long group project, we thought it would be meaningful to analyze this
business' trends in a time series format. Geospatial data visualizations were created, as well as
sophisticated time-series models. We also integrated key bullet-pointed insights for executives/
stakeholders, so that they could apply our findings in real time.

The results of our final model supported our original hypothesis, which was that Airbnb does impact
median real estate prices.
